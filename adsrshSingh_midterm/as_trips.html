	 <h2>My Best Trip Story</h2>
	 <p> It was month of march, me and my friend decided to go to shrigul temple, in HIMACHAL by tracking , that was our first time. We started oyr journey in the morning near 8'Clock, We went thorough bridges, rivers, lakes , waterfalls, also people who lives in mountains.
	  We carry out food and water together , people tell us that there are some dangerous animal , so be careful. While tracking i saw a baby bear sleeping in his cave and i told my frien to stop the damn music. That was scary moment for me , than we slowly passed him. Going forward 
      we watched many beautiful views, we can see the place where we starts and also far form it , we can see the whole village from up there. But it still time to reach our Destination. Moving upward me and my friend are getting tired but we didn't stop, Suddenly from nowhere rain starts puoring
      me and my friend run and hid under the tree. We wait for rain to stop , after half n hour rain stops and we continue are journey. About 5 km away from our journey we see snow all over the mountain, we paly with snow for a while , it was already  afternoon. We saw a house top after an hour, after saw that top of house me and my frien got our spirit back and 
      start moving forward to it. We reached our destination, i can't tell you in word's how wonderful was that view , watching mountains under the snow , watching sunset from that above. It was 12000ft up from where we started , oxygen level was a little low.We rached at 5:00pm after starting in 8:00 of morning. All the temples and house was deeply under the snow  
	  house were closed and shops too ..only temple was open .Than we called the priest and do a little worship of lord shiva. We told the priest can we stay here today just for a night , he directly refused, he said the police said no one is allowed to stay. We said nothing and we leave.
	  Now , story didn't end here ,the real part is here now. We started to going downward , while on my path for 15 minutes. I saw a langoor on top a tree , i ignored it i thought it just one i continuesd on my path. Than all of trees of my left side start moving from top and when i saw up there where dozens of langoors watching me and my friend and following us. I got panic i picked a hard stick and also give one to my friend 
	  , they were in our way so we changed our path and the funny part is we got lost .....After 30 min. we were back on track. It was already dark and cold so my friend said me that we shoud stay somewhere for night. When we started our journey we thought that we will stay at the temple 
	  but fate had something else for us.</p>

      <p>Nevermind, back to my story , we had nothing , no food , no extra warm cloths and no tent, we have only dringking water that was cold too. We stop at a place near a river, where we found a hollow tree we stay for there like anhour , than the temprature is getting down so we move forward and found a broken house and a plastic big sheet.
	   We made arrangments and stay there whole night, well we haven't slept cause the cold and rain. My best morning ever, it was 6:20am my friend told to lets go , that moment where i was slept near a river , alittle poring of rain and singing birds in the morning, with natural air and peace. I was in the jungle with all these awsomethings.
	   we start had back to the village, while going back we got confused so we went to ahouse near by we asked them which is way to the village , the asked us where are we coming from , they asked us for tea and we shouls wait at there for while. We waited there , they gave us food to eat , tea to drink , we had fun we those people ,we told them our story.
	   After that thye gave us umbrellas and we thank you them , and clicked some pics with them , those where very nice peoples and we had back to the village.</p>
